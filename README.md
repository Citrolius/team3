## What was our challenge?

To speed up the post GWAS analysis - from markers to genes.

We obtained yield data for 2014 from the [AHDB recommended list](https://cereals.ahdb.org.uk) of winter wheat, 
as climatic variation was smaller in this year than in other years (Bastiaan, personal communication).   
We selected two high yielding varieties: Solstice and Skyfall.
